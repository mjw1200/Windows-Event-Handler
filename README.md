# Windows Event Handler

The Visual Studio Project in this repo is actually called "Uptime" because that's how I started messing around with Windows events - I used to be able to view my Windows 10 uptime on the Task Manager's Performance tab, but that apparently went away with the "Creator's Update." So I started digging into Windows event logging to create my own.

I think this may be more generally useful with some work, so I stuck it into git. For other applications and reuse, you're probably most interested in the EventReader class.
